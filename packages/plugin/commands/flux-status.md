# Kenzo Status (`/flux-status`)

Show the current state of your Kenzo board and suggest what to work on next.

## Instructions

1. Use `list_projects` to get all projects with their stats.

2. For the active project (or most recently updated), use `list_epics` and `list_tasks` to get the full picture.

3. Present a summary:
   - Tasks in progress (doing)
   - Blocked tasks and what's blocking them
   - Tasks ready to start (todo with no blockers)
   - Recently completed tasks

4. Suggest the next task to pick up based on:
   - Unblocking other tasks (high impact)
   - No dependencies (ready to start)
   - Epic progress (finishing an epic)
